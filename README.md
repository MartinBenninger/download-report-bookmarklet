# download-report-bookmarklet
A small bookmarklet for downloading reports from Jazz Report Builder as SVG files.

This will create an SVG file with the report looking exactly as it does in the browser. Report builder has the option to export as an SVG file but it doesn't look exactly the same. For example, the text size is much smaller in the exported SVG file created by report builder.

## Usage
- Drag this bookmarklet << Download Report >> into the bookmarks bar.
- Open a report in report builder and run it.
- When the report is loaded, click the "Download Report" bookmark.
- Within seconds, the report should automatically download as an SVG file.
